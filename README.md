# Wave

A basic game written in Java. The goal is to move your character(white square) and dodge the other characters, some moving in random directions and other chasing after you! Pressing SPACE lets you enter the shop and pause the game as well or you could also hit P to pause. USE the W,A,S,D keys to navigate your character. That is all, enjoy!
